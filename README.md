# Political Society Argument & Source Database Engine

A self-hosted catalogue for a political society's arguments, evidence and source
material. Members record entries (studies, articles, statistics, policy papers),
tag them by stance and party/source, attach a link or upload a file, and connect
entries into a **clash map** of how arguments counter, rebut, evidence or update
one another. A public view exposes non-private entries; everything else is
members-only. While this app is specifically designed for political societies, it will work well for all argument or source tracking purposes.

The stack is deliberately lightweight: a Node/Express + PostgreSQL API and a
**vanilla** HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend with **no build step and no frameworks**.

## Architecture

**Backend** — Express 4 on Node 20+, PostgreSQL 15+ via `pg`. Passwords are
hashed with Argon2id. File uploads are handled by Multer and stored on disk
*outside* the web root, served back only through an authenticated, access-checked
route. Sessions are opaque IDs held in a database table and referenced by an
`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict` cookie.

**Frontend** — Static HTML pages under `public/`, styled with two hand-written
CSS files and driven by ES-module JavaScript. There is no bundler; the browser
loads the modules directly. Party/source colours are **not** hardcoded — they are
fetched from the API and applied at runtime, keeping the `sources` table the
single source of truth.

**Anonymisation** is enforced on the server. The raw `uploader_id` never leaves
the API; entries marked anonymous are returned as "Anonymous Member".

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20 or newer**
- **PostgreSQL 15 or newer** (the schema uses `gen_random_uuid()` from the
  built-in `pgcrypto`/`pg_catalog`, deferred constraint triggers and enum types)
- A POSIX-like shell for the setup commands below

---

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Create the database and an application role (example)
createdb political_society
#   …or with psql:
#   CREATE DATABASE political_society;
#   CREATE USER psdb_app WITH PASSWORD '…';
#   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE political_society TO psdb_app;

# 3. Configure the environment
cp .env.example .env
#   Edit .env — set DATABASE_URL and FILE_STORE_PATH at minimum.

# 4. Create the schema (tables, enums, triggers, seed sources)
npm run migrate
#   (this runs: psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f db/schema.sql)
#   Ensure DATABASE_URL is exported in your shell, or run psql directly.

# 5. Make the file-store directory and ensure the app can write to it
mkdir -p "$(grep '^FILE_STORE_PATH' .env | cut -d= -f2-)"

# 6. Seed the single Root account (prints a one-time temporary password)
npm run seed-root
#   Optionally pass a username:  node scripts/seed-root.js chair

# 7. Start the server
npm start
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000/` for the public view, or `/login.html` to sign
in. The Root account's temporary password is shown **once** by step 6 — sign in
with it and you will be required to set a new password immediately.

The schema seeds 13 UK party/source presets (with badge colours) and these
cannot be deleted. Additional sources can be added from the entry form.

## Environment variables

| Variable          | Required | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DATABASE_URL`    | yes      | PostgreSQL connection string.                                               |
| `FILE_STORE_PATH` | yes      | Absolute path for uploaded files. **Must be outside the web root.**         |
| `PORT`            | no       | HTTP port (default `3000`).                                                 |
| `NODE_ENV`        | no       | `production` forces Secure cookies and suppresses verbose errors.           |
| `COOKIE_SECURE`   | no       | In non-production only, set `false` to allow cookies over plain-HTTP local. |

---

## Running

```bash
npm start      # production-style start
npm run dev    # auto-restart on file changes (node --watch)
```

`GET /api/health` returns `{ "status": "ok", "db": "connected" }` when the server
and database are reachable.

## API overview

All endpoints are under `/api`. Errors use the shape
`{ "error": "<CODE>", ... }` (e.g. `VALIDATION` includes a `fields` map).

## Roles & permissions

Permission ladder: **Read → Write → Admin → Root**.

- **Read** — browse members-only entries.
- **Write** — also create entries/sources/keywords/relations and edit *their own* entries.
- **Admin** — also manage Read/Write members, edit/delete any entry, and remove relations.
- **Root** — the single superuser. Can manage Admins and transfer the Root role.
  There is always exactly one Root; the role moves via **Transfer Crown**, never by
  direct promotion. Admins may only assign Read/Write; only Root may grant Admin.

A separate **society role** (President, General Secretary, Treasurer,
Extended-Committee, Member, Alumni) is descriptive metadata and is independent of
the permission level.

---

## Security model

- **Passwords**: Argon2id (m=64 MiB, t=3, p=4) with a per-hash salt.
- **Sessions**: opaque DB-backed IDs in an `HttpOnly` + `Secure` +
  `SameSite=Strict` cookie (8 h). A forced reset issues a *restricted* 30-minute
  pre-session that only the change-password endpoint accepts.
- **Login anti-enumeration**: unknown user, inactive account and wrong password
  all return an identical `401`.
- **File access**: stored outside the web root with UUID filenames, served only
  through `/api/files/:filename` with a path-traversal guard and the same
  public/private visibility rule as the owning entry; sent `Content-Disposition: inline`.
- **Anonymisation** and the **public/private boundary** are enforced server-side;
  the frontend never receives data it should not show.
- **Headers**: a strict Content-Security-Policy (`default-src 'self'`, no inline
  scripts or styles, `object-src 'none'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`), `nosniff`,
  `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, and HSTS in production.
- **SQL** is fully parameterised; **login is rate-limited** (10/IP/minute).
- The frontend stores **no** session data in `localStorage`/`sessionStorage`;
  role-gated UI is a convenience only — the API is the sole authority.

Because the CSP forbids external and inline scripts/styles, the UI uses **local
system font stacks** rather than web fonts, and applies all dynamic styling
(e.g. party badge colours) through the CSSOM from JavaScript.
